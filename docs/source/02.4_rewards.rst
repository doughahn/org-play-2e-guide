Boons
***********************************
Boons are rewards that can be applied to a character. Common types of boons include Achievemnet Points (AcP), Chronicle, or Faction.  Boons often have traits that describe how the boon applies. There are some boon traits that deserve specific mention:

  Advanced  
    A boon with the Advanced trait is typically more powerful than other boons.  Characters may only benefit from one advanced boon during an adventure.
  Ally
    A boon with the Ally trait sometimes places a Pawn.  This does not allow players to bypass the limits on the number of :ref:`Pawns<Character Options>` they can play.
  Promotional 
    These boons reward players for promoting the society, or for exceptional contributions to the campaign. Characters may only benefit from one promotional boon during an adventure.

Unless a boon states otherwise, you can only apply one of any given boon to a character.

    Games played in stores, homes, or other locations.

*Not all Adventures and Adventure Path books award 12 XP. See the individual sanctioning documents for details.*

A list of  Achievement Points rewards available for purchase lives on the Boon tab of your `My Organized Play page <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. To purchase a boon, select a character from the dropdown list, then click the purchase button of the desired boon. A list of purchased boons appears at the bottom of the page. Each purchased boon generates a downloadable printable boon. AcP boons should be stored with Chronicles, either digitally or alongside physical sheets. 

Retail Incentive Program 
==================================

The Retail Incentive Program (RIP) rewards Players with rewards for their characters when they patronize retailers who are providing space for Organized Play activities.  Purchases made at the location within a stated time frame tally by table and unlock benefits at different levels, including some that reduce the severity of failures, for the next game played. Implementation methods vary from store to store, and are posted for attendees to review. For more information, read the `full policy <https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies#retailers>`_ and consult your :ref:`Event Coordinator` for details.

Legacy Backgrounds (legacy campaign) 
===================================================
Even though characters from the First Edition legacy campaign cannot transfer into the current Pathfinder Society campaign, their exploits can shape the Society’s newest adventurers. For each of the 11 :term:`Season` of the legacy campaign, a Player can unlock a special legacy character background associated with that season by having completed five or more of that season’s scenarios. These backgrounds are unique to the Pathfinder Society campaign, and once they’re unlocked, a Player use a legacy background for any number of characters. See :ref:`Legacy Backgrounds`.

Other Rewards (Player)
==================================== 
Pathfinder Society Organized Play periodically releases additional prizes for special events. The most common among these are charity boons, which are in-game benefits sent to authorized charity events to help raise money for good causes. For more information on Charity Boons, ask the :ref:`Event Coordinator`. 

Faction & Reputation
==================================

All agents, provided they have been confirmed by having gone on at least 2 missions, are awarded a free wayfinder. In addition, any agent of the pathfinder society can purchase the following boons from the “boons” tab of `My Organized Play <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_

Table: Faction Reputations
-----------------------------

By representing a :ref:`Faction<Factions (Player)>` during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction’s interests, a character gains Reputation with the represented faction. The greater a character’s Reputation the more respected and influential they are with that faction. Characters can represent more that one Faction in their career, but only one per adventure. Some scenarios grant bonus Reputation with particular factions; this doesn’t prevent characters from choosing to represent a different Faction.

Pathfinder Society uses the Reputation subsystem (`Gamemastery Guide 164 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1234>`_)  with the following modifications:
