Welcome to the Pathfinder Society
=================================

Pathfinder Society (second edition) is a worldwide fantasy roleplaying campaign set on the world of Golarion during the Age of Lost Omens. As agents of the Pathfinder Society, a legendary league of explorers, archaeologists, and adventurers headquartered in Absalom, you dedicate your life to discovering and chronicling the greatest mysteries and wonders of an ancient world. Pathfinder adventures range from exploring the dark alleys to engaging in political intrigues to embarking on far-flung travels to exciting locales.

Pathfinder Society (second edition) uses Paizo’s Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset and Lost Omens setting under the campaign leadership of the Paizo Organized Play Team. This guide presents the information you need to participate in this exciting, dynamic campaign. Welcome to the Pathfinder Society!

What Is Paizo Organized Play?
-----------------------------
In a Paizo organized play campaign, your character adventures in a shared setting with thousands of other gamers worldwide. Anyone can host games, in homes, game stores, libraries, conventions, and online, as long as they report the adventurer’s results afterward. Reporting earns participants campaign rewards and player actions influence the fate of the Lost Omens setting. 

As part of the organized play experience, you can take your characters to any Pathfinder Society (second edition) event in the world, allowing you to join a game with friends and strangers alike with ease. And after each adventure, your characters grow stronger and carry their rewards with them to the next adventure, even if your fellow players and Game Masters (GMs) change between adventures. The Paizo organized play experience is uniquely immersive, as the diverse range of players, GMs, and characters provide incredible depth. The campaign is also a great way to meet other gamers and play regularly without needing to schedule regular events with a single set of people as you might for a more traditional game.

In order to help the Pathfinder Society (second edition) program function smoothly in a shared-world environment, the campaign has some additional rules to ensure a fair and equal experience for all participants—no matter who is playing or running the game. The rest of this guide covers that information. 

Besides the Pathfinder Society (second edition) campaign, Paizo Organized Play programs also includes the Starfinder Society, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, and the Pathfinder Society (first edition) campaigns. 

Paizo’s organized play team oversees the campaign’s content and program structure, and team members include the Organized Play Manager, Organized Play Managing Developer, Pathfinder Society developers, and the Pathfinder Society design liaison. Volunteers called `Venture-Officers <http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/volunteer-coordinator-page/>`_ facilitate the campaign by coordinating the worldwide network of players and GMs.

Characters
----------
Next, you need a character to play. You can either use a pre-generated character or create your own character.

Using a Pregenerated Character
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you don’t have time to create a new character or want to try out a new character class, you can use a pregenerated character, also called a pregen, based on the Pathfinder iconic characters. A player can choose any of the pregerated characters without owning the associated rule books or sources. You can download `Pathfinder Community Use Package: PF2E Iconics Pregenerated Characters <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5>`_ or request them from your local event coordinator.

Using Your Own Character
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have the time, and know what you want to play, you can build your character following the rules in the :ref:`Character Rules for Society` appendix.

After you are done building your character, register them by going to your organized play account, sign in, and click on the “Register a New Pathfinder Society (second edition) Character.”
