<dl class="glossary simple">
<dt id="term-Access">Access</dt><dd><p>This stat block entry indicates that you can use a rules element even though it’s uncommon by virtue of belonging to a particular organization, hailing from a particular region, or meeting another such criterion. For example, members of the Pathfinder Society begin with access to most options of common rarity, but also gain access to wayfinders because of their membership in that organization, even though wayfinders are uncommon in Golarion. See Special Rewards.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Achievement-Points-ACP">Achievement Points (ACP)</dt><dd><p>Achievement Points are a reward for participating in the Pathfinder Society Campaign, earned through playing and GMing adventures. You can redeem these points for special boons for your characters. See Special Rewards.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="term-Alignment-Infraction">Alignment Infraction</dt><dd><p>An Alignment Infraction is any intentionally evil action or suitably callous criminal action that results in a character gaining Infamy. The consequences of Alignment Infractions vary from limits on purchases to forced retirement of a character from the Pathfinder Society campaign.

</dd>
<dt id="term-Apply-a-Chronicle">Apply a Chronicle</dt><dd><p>Applying a Chronicle sheet means filling out all of its information and modifying your character’s information accordingly.

</dd>
<dt id="term-Boon">Boon</dt><dd><p>A boon is an in-game reward other than Experience Points, wealth, Fame, Downtime, or item access.

You must bring all Chronicle sheets for a character to Organized Play games in order to be able to use that character, but if you have them, you can play that character at any Pathfinder Society event of the appropriate level anywhere in the world!

</dd>
<dt id="term-Downtime">Downtime</dt><dd><p>This is a unit of time granted by a Chronicle sheet that a character can spend to perform a number of activities, such as Crafting or attempting to Earn Income.
