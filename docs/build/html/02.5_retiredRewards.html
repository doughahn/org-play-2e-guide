<h2>Playtest Points<a class="headerlink" href="#playtest-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Playtest Points (playtest adventures): During the playtest period for Pathfinder Second Edition, players and GMs did not earn Chronicles when playing the 11 playtest adventures. Instead, each participant earned a number of Playtest Points, which can now be redeemed on your <a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Organized Play account at Paizo</a>. These rewards include Limited-Use boons, the ability to start a character at 2nd or 3rd level to reflect the time spent playing the game, and other minor benefits.</p>

<p>Starting in season 2, Adventures no longer give Fame. There will be a new Faction boon System coming out, in the next few months, and a mechanism to transition your boons over to the new system. Once the new system is in place, you will no longer be able to buy Faction boons with fame. The current date for the transition is 10/20/2020</p>
<p>Additionally, the following faction boons have been changed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alliance Champion boons no longer do anything and have ceased to exist.</p></li>
<li><p>All characters gain the effect of the Home Region boon for free at character creation. As such, the boon no longer serves any function.</p></li>

<h2>Faction Boon Rewards<a class="headerlink" href="#faction-boon-rewards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Factions offer a variety of rewards. These a PC can access by gaining Reputation with a particular faction and then spending Fame to purchase specific boons. In addition to faction-specific rewards, there are numerous generic rewards that are accessible to all factions based on the amount of Reputation a PC’s earned. The rewards take the form of boons, which follow the same rules as those found in the <a class="reference internal" href="02.3_rewards.html#boons"><span class="std std-ref">Boons</span></a> section.</p>
<p>Reputation Tiers: By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction’s interests, a PC gains Reputation with that faction. The greater a PC’s Reputation with a faction, the more respected and influential they are with that faction, represented by their Reputation Tier. These tiers are numbered 0 through 4, with a Reputation Tier of 0 representing no relationship with the faction, and a Reputation Tier of 4 representing the height of prestige within the faction. To advance to a higher Reputation Tier, a PC must increase their Reputation for that faction to the values listed in the following table.</p>

<div><dl>
<dt>Adversary Lore</dt><dd><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilant Seal Tier 1</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how powerful your weapons are if you don’t know where to strike. Before an adventure, you take time to study a certain category of creatures, making it easier to recall their capabilities later. When you purchase this boon, either select one creature type from List 1 below, or choose two creature types from List 2. While this boon is slotted, you have a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures of the selected type(s). If your Reputation Tier for the Vigilant Seal faction is 4, this bonus increases to +2.</p>
<p><strong>List 1</strong> aberration, animal, beast, construct, dragon, elemental, fiend, undead.</p>
<p><strong>List 2</strong> astral, celestial, ethereal, fey, fungus, giant, monitor, ooze, plant.</p>

When you play or GM an adventure at a Paizo Organized Play event designated as Premium or Premium Plus, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Grand Archive faction.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Grand Archive faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Beginnings and Endings</dt><dd><p>slotless</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Verdant Wheel Tier 1</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 0 Fame</p>
<p>Serve as the event organizer or headquarters volunteer for an event that includes Pathfinder Society adventures or assist these volunteers in setting up or cleaning up after such an event. When you do so, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Verdant Wheel faction on the next scenario you play.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Verdant Wheel faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your next Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.

</dd>
<dt>Bequeathal</dt><dd><p>service</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> All Factions Tier 3</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> Varies</p>
<p>Pathfinders often find strange treasures for which they might not have any use, yet one of their colleagues would benefit. When you acquire this boon, select one uncommon, rare, or unique character option to which you’ve gained <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Access"><span class="xref std std-term">Access</span></a> through an adventure’s Chronicle sheet (e.g., a boon that allows you to acquire a <strong>Special</strong> animal companion or purchase a <strong>Special</strong> magic item). Choose another of your characters. That character gains <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Access"><span class="xref std std-term">Access</span></a> to that <strong>Special</strong> option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle sheet’s adventure (e.g., 5th level for Tier 5–8). On the Chronicle sheet, write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character’s number next to the option. You no longer have <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Access"><span class="xref std std-term">Access</span></a> to that option (and must sell it back if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).</p>
<p>The <strong>Cost</strong> of this boon is 4 Fame for an uncommon option, 8 Fame for a rare option, and 12 Fame for a unique option.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you bequeath a different character option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bring Them Back Alive</dt><dd><p>social</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Envoys’ Alliance Tier 3</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 2 Fame</p>
<p>You are able to leverage your connections within the Society to raise funds for your allies’ resurrection, ensuring that everyone lives to see another adventure. You and your allies treat your effective character levels as 1 lower for the purpose of the raise dead spell and the resurrection ritual. This applies to both the level of the spell or ritual required, as well as to calculating the <strong>Cost</strong> of the diamonds necessary to cast the spell or perform the ritual.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Charitable Adventure</dt><dd><p>slotless</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Radiant Oath Tier 1</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 0 Fame</p>
<p>Although the Society focuses on exploration and discovery, the Pathfinders’ exploits also earn them a considerable income—a portion of which you donate to those in need. When you play or GM an adventure at a charity event registered with the Organized Play Foundation, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Radiant Oath faction.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Radiant Oath faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Consummate Dabbler</dt><dd><p>slotless</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Horizon Hunters Tier 1</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 0 Fame</p>
<p>It’s not enough to simply see the world; you’re driven to experience local cultures’ unfamiliar customs, too. When you play a Pathfinder Adventure Card Society scenario or a Starfinder Society scenario, you earn 2 additional Fame and Reputation with the Horizon Hunters faction on the next scenario you play.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Horizon Hunters faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.

</dd>
<dt>Crafter’s Workshop</dt><dd><p>Downtime</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Envoy’s Alliance Tier 2</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
<p>Your friends in the Envoy’s Alliance share crafting materials and collaborate to create new items more efficiently. You only need to spend 1 day of downtime before attempting your skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective <strong>Cost</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Curse Breaker</dt><dd><p>Downtime</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilant Seal Tier 2</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 2 Fame</p>
<p>You have been entrusted with an accursed item from the Society’s vaults, and you can spend your time in the Grand Lodge patiently unraveling its malign influence. When you acquire this boon choose a permanent magic item of your level or lower to which you have <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Access"><span class="xref std std-term">Access</span></a>. While you have this boon slotted, you can spend Downtime erasing the item’s stubborn curse. This uses the same rules as you would to Craft the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion in place of Crafting (such as to determine the progress you make and the maximum item level you can work on). Second, your faction provides you the necessary tools and workspace to perform this operation. Third, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective <strong>Cost</strong>. You must keep this boon slotted until you finish uncursing the item.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you do so, you select a different item.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Eager Protégé</dt><dd><p>ally, limited-use</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Envoys’ Alliance Tier 2</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
<p>A promising recruit, initiate, or recently confirmed field agent accompanies you while you have this boon slotted. This disciple observes your adventuring exploits and occasionally contributes directly; once per adventure before you attempt a skill check or attack roll, the ally successfully Aids you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering check.</p>
<p>Tally the amount of XP you earn while this boon is slotted. Once you have tallied 60 or more XP in this way, you can encourage your protégé to set off on their own on new adventures. When this happens, you can no longer slot this boon; however, you can expend the boon when creating a new character to begin the character at 2nd level with 12 XP, 12 Fame, 30 gp, and 12 Reputation to distribute among any number of legal factions. Once expended in this way, this boon provides no other benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can purchase this boon multiple times, but you can only tally XP credit toward one such ally at a time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exotic Edge</dt><dd><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Horizon Hunters Tier 3</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
<p>By traveling so widely, you have developed an intuitive talent for using esoteric techniques. Once per adventure, you can activate this boon as a free action to apply these techniques, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to either all of your attack rolls or all of your skill checks for 1 round.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Heroic Defiance</dt><dd><p>heroic</p>

</dd>
<dt>Heroic Inspiration</dt><dd><p>heroic</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Envoys’ Alliance Tier 3</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
<p>Your most momentous actions can inspire your allies to follow suit. When you use a Hero Point to reroll a check and succeed at the check, your allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks of the same type for 1 round (such as attack rolls, Will saves, or Perception checks).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Heroic Intervention</dt><dd><p>heroic</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Radiant Oath Tier 3</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> 4 Fame</p>
