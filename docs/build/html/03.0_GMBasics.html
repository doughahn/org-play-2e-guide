<h1>Game Master Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#game-master-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Running Pathfinder Society games is similar to running a home campaign with a few house rules established by campaign leadership. In addition to GM Basics, be sure to familiarize yourself with the contents of the <a class="reference internal" href="01.0_welcome.html#welcome-to-the-pathfinder-society"><span class="std std-ref">Welcome to the Pathfinder Society</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="01.2_standards.html#community-standards-expectations"><span class="std std-ref">Community Standards &amp; Expectations</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="02.0_playerBasics.html#players"><span class="std std-ref">Player Basics</span></a>. You need to know what players know, what their expectations are, and how their characters are created, played, and advanced.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-gm">
<h2>What Is A GM?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-gm" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>A Game Master (GM) is the person who presents the story, adjudicates the rules, and establishes the parameters of the playerâs exploration. A GMâs duty is to provide a fair and fun game for all involved, including themselves. In the Pathfinder Society, a GM has a few other duties, listed in Your Duties as a Game Master below.</p>
<div class="section" id="who-can-be-a-game-master">
<h3>Who Can Be A Game Master?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-be-a-game-master" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Anyone with a <a class="reference internal" href="01.0_welcome.html#register-for-organized-play"><span class="std std-ref">valid Organized Play ID</span></a> can run Pathfinder Society adventures. As local Pathfinder Society groups and the campaign as a whole benefit as the pool of Game Masters increases, the venture-officer network provides support and guidance for any who want to GM.</p>

<div class="section" id="your-duties-as-game-master">
<h3>Your Duties As Game Master<a class="headerlink" href="#your-duties-as-game-master" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the following duties:
- Communicate with your local event coordinator.
- Prepare an adventure to offer to players, including gathering the necessary supplies such as maps, miniatures, and reference materials.
- Provide a welcoming environment for players.
- Deliver session results to the player via established recording mechanisms.
- Report the results of the game.</p>

<h3>Where Can I Buy Adventures?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-can-i-buy-adventures" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Paizo produces two categories of adventures, available for purchase at <a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety">paizo.com</a>.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Society adventures, including quests, scenarios, and bounties, generally release during the last week of each month. Current production rates include two new scenarios and one bounty monthly, with additional Society content released periodically throughout the year. These adventures are written expressly for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Adventures, including Adventure Paths, Modules, and Stand-alone adventures, are produced monthly. These adventures are oftentimes sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign. Information on how to incorporate them into your Society experience is found on each productâs description page at paizo.com. (See types of <a class="reference internal" href="02.0_playerBasics.html#adventures"><span class="std std-ref">Adventures</span></a> for more about these products.)</p>

<div class="section" id="reviewing-chronicles">
<h3>Reviewing Chronicles<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-chronicles" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>If time permits, GMs and Event Coordinators should spend a few minutes reviewing playersâ Chronicles at the start of an event slot. These reviews can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, GMs might need to check to the Adventure Summary section to learn what a character did in a previous adventure, and GMs and Coordinators can review Chronicles to ensure that they are filled out correctly. These reviews can help ensure that players understand the rules of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder Society Campaign, as well as catch the errors that naturally crop up in the course of play. (See <a class="reference internal" href="03.4_dealingWithUnexpected.html#dealing-with-chronicle-errors"><span class="std std-ref">Dealing with Chronicle Errors</span></a> for more on this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenge-points">
<h3>Challenge Points<a class="headerlink" href="#challenge-points" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>In a typical home game, the PCs would all be the same level and face challenges tailored to their level. In an organized play environment, though, there needs to be more flexibility to make it easier for players whose characters are of different levels to participate in the same adventure.</p>
<p>Each scenario or quest will list the levels of characters able to play in it, as well one or more level ranges within the adventure.  If an adventure has more than 2 level ranges each table must choose 2 adjacent level ranges for that adventure.  Only Characters of a level that falls within those two level ranges can play in that adventure at that table.</p>
<p>GMs should adjust the scenario before play begins, following the steps below.</p>
<div class="section" id="calculating-challenge-points">
<h4>1. Calculating Challenge Points<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-challenge-points" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>To calculate the number of Challenge Points the party represents, take the following steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Record the PCsâ levels. The number of Challenge Points that each PC contributes is based only on their character levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the Adventures âBase Levelâ.  The base level is the lowest level allowed to play at that table.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the PCsâ levels to Challenge Points.   Table 1 below notes how many Challenge Points each PC of a given level represents.</p></li>

<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>For example, an adventure for levels 1-4  would have a Base Level of 1.  So a 2nd-level PC in such an adventure has a level of Base Level + 1, and by the chart, contributes 3 Challenge Points. A party of five PCs levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4 would contribute 2, 3, 4, 6, and 6 points respectively.</p>

<h4>2. Determine the Level Range<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-the-level-range" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Parties with challenge points of 15 or less always play in the lower level range.  Parties with 19 or more always play in the higher level range.</p>
<p>Parties with 16-18 play in the higher level range only if they have 4 or fewer PCs. If they have 5 or more PCs, they play in the lower level range.  This allows small parties of high level adventurers to play in the higher level range, while large parties of low level adventurers play in the lower level range.</p>
<div class="section" id="mentorship-and-pc-level-bumps">
<h5>Mentorship and PC Level Bumps<a class="headerlink" href="#mentorship-and-pc-level-bumps" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h5>
<p>To provide low level players a more fun and fair experience, PCs whose level equals the adventureâs base level (such as a 3rd-level PC playing in a Level 3â6 scenario) gain a temporary boost when playing in the higher level range called a level bump to represent the higher-level PCsâ mentorship and support.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Increase every DC the PC has by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and AC of the PC by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the Hit Point totals of the PC by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These adjustments are less beneficial than gaining a level, yet they provide the PC more survivability and opportunity to contribute to the adventure experience, reducing the degree to which higher-level PCs might overshadow these less experienced Pathfinders.</p>
<p>You should also remind higher level PCs to apply any mentor boons they might have purchased.</p>

<h4>3. Adjusting the Adventure<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-the-adventure" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>

In each of these cases, use the numbers, creatures, and other information listed for the selected level range.</p>

<h3>Table Variation<a class="headerlink" href="#table-variation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A goal of the Pathfinder Society program is to provide a fun, engaging, consistent experience at all tables. GMs should run Pathfinder Society adventures as written, which means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>No change to major plot points and interactions</p></li>
<li><p>No addition or subtraction to the number of monsters other than scaling directed by the scenario</p></li>
<li><p>No changes to armor, feats, items, skills, spells, statistics, traits, or weapons.</p></li>
<li><p>No alteration of mechanics of player characters,</p></li>
<li><p>Nor banning of  legal character options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the above, GMs are encouraged to make choices which would result in the most enjoyable play experience for everyone at the table and that emphasize PCs are the heroes of the story. Some examples of GM discretion include the following.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Creatures tactics that have been invalidated by the player actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Unclear rules, or situations or player actions not covered by the rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrain or environmental conditions described by the scenario, but not given mechanics.  (If the mechanics are included, however, they cannot be altered.)</p></li>
<li><p>Reactions of NPCs to good roleplaying, and the effect that has on the outcome of the encounter.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate or creative skills used to bypass or overcome traps, haunts, and skill checks.  (Although the DCs and results of the check are part of the mechanics and should not be changed.)</p></li>
<li><p>Aspects of the scenarioâs description and story as appropriate for the players at the table as described in the section A Welcoming Environment on pages <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=486">485â486 of the Core Rulebook</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes required to comply with the <a class="reference internal" href="01.2_standards.html#acceptable-content"><span class="std std-ref">Acceptable Content</span></a> provision of Community Standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Creative solutions presented by players in overcoming obstacles.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving plot points missed by players to encounterable areas (this does not include moving missed treasure bundles).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More details on each of these can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="03.3_tableVariation.html#table-variations-creative-solutions"><span class="std std-ref">Table Variations &amp; Creative Solutions</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Advancement Speed (GM)<a class="headerlink" href="#advancement-speed-gm" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Some players may be making use of the Slow Advancement Additional Character Option. If they are, they should have marked their character as âSlowâ on the sign in sheet. In this case divide XP, Primary and Secondary Reputation, and Gold from treasure bundles in half (Do not round). It will also affect downtime, but the player is responsible for handling that.</p>

<div class="section" id="reputation-gm">
<h3>Reputation (GM)<a class="headerlink" href="#reputation-gm" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Each adventure lists how much reputation to award.  Typically Scenarios will award 2 Reputation for accomplishing the mission you were sent on and 2 more for going above and beyond expectations (for a total of 4 Reputation gained.)  Scenarios with the Faction tag will often reward an additional 2 Reputation with the highlighted Faction for completing the factions goals. See the <a class="reference internal" href="02.4_rewards.html#faction-reputation"><span class="std std-ref">Reputation</span></a> section for more on reputation.</p>
<p>A quest typically grants 1 Reputation.  Sanctioned Adventures have variable Reputation rewards called out in the sanctioning documentation.</p>

Most scenarios are designed to award 8 Treasure Bundles, with 2 bonus Treasure Bundles available through exceptional play. The chart below gives the value of individual treasure bundles, and the most common values.</p>
<p>Quests, Bounties, and sanctioned adventures  grant standardized gold rewards instead of  Treasure Bundles. In the case of Quests, this is 2.5 Treasure Bundles.</p>

<h3>Sanctioned Adventures<a class="headerlink" href="#sanctioned-adventures" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the two types of adventures written for Pathfinder Society, several of the other adventures Paizo produces have been sanctioned for society play.  All of these are published for a wider audience than the Pathfinder Society campaign, so such adventures often include a short, downloadable sanctioning document that details any special considerations for running the adventure for organized play, as well as Chronicles for the individual volumes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>Pathfinder Adventure Paths</dt><dd><p>Multi-volume campaigns representing dozens of game sessions to complete. Many Adventure Paths are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pathfinder Adventures</dt><dd><p>Stand-alone adventure books that take one or more sessions to complete. Many Adventures are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bounties</dt><dd><p>Short one-hour adventures aimed at  introducing new players to the game or representing what characters do in between Pathfinder missions. Bounties are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign. As a sanctioned adventure, bounties do not give down time.</p>

<h3>Modes of Play<a class="headerlink" href="#modes-of-play" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The society rules for play are customized to work with Pathfinder Quests and Scenarios, and are not necessarily applicable to other sanctioned adventures.  As such, PFS has 2 different modes for play:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>Society Mode</dt><dd><p>Society Mode is used for PFS Scenarios and Quests, and adheres to all the rules published in this guide.  Society mode is governed by the Run as Written provisions in Game Master Basics.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Adventure Mode</dt><dd><p>Adventure Mode is used for adventures not published for society play, and allows the GM more freedom to adapt those adventures, including running the  adventure in Pathfinder using GM house rules, and the ability to alter encounters and statistics found in the adventure.</p>

</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="character-types">
<h3>Character Types<a class="headerlink" href="#character-types" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Most Pathfinder Society Scenarios and Quests require the use of a PFS character or PFS sanctioned Pregen.  However some come with separate sets  of pregens.  Most Adventure Mode sanctioned products can be played with any character, however some have pregens, and players are encouraged to play those characters for an optimal experience.</p>

<h3>Sanctioning Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#sanctioning-documents" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Each Sanctioned Adventure comes with a freely downloadable Sanctioning Document located on the productâs description page on paizo.com.  This document contains the rules for running that adventure, as well as chronicles rewarded for completion.  GMs should read the sanctioning document charefully, as it may modify the Adventures rewards.   Unlike Pathfinder Society adventures, Chronicles for Sanctioned Adventures are assigned at the completion of the adventure.</p>
