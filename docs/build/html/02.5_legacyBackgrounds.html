<h1>Legacy Backgrounds<a class="headerlink" href="#legacy-backgrounds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following backgrounds are special options available only to players who participated in the First Edition campaign, representing unique character hooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl>
<dt>Early Explorer Background</dt><dd><p>In the past decade, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with demonic armies, meddled in politics, and more, but you joined the organization before everything seemed so complicated. Whether you’re a dedicated scholar of ruins or an explorer who just longs for months-long expeditions into the wilderness, you’re a Pathfinder to explore, report, and cooperate.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Pathfinder Society Lore skill. You gain the Forager skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Seasons 0 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Shadow War Survivor Background</dt><dd><p>Countless factions have fought for influence in Absalom for millennia, and for decades these groups worked through the Pathfinder Society to better control the City at the Center of the World. Perhaps you were ones of these agents who clashed with other operatives during the so-called Shadow War. Or you might have been an unintended victim of these clandestine clashes, inspiring you to join the Society and stop the conflict from within. Whatever the reason, navigating the Shadow War has left you politically savvy and informed.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Society skill and the Absalom Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 1 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Shadow Lodge Defector Background</dt><dd><p>You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society’s loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders’ reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You’ve since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 2 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast Background</dt><dd><p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated, or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the Combat Climber skill feat. In addition, you gain <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Access"><span class="xref std std-term">Access</span></a> to one of the following uncommon monk weapons: kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, or temple sword.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 3 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Thassilonian Delver Background</dt><dd><p>As archaeologists uncovered and explored ever-larger numbers of Thassilonian ruins, you were among the eager explorers who sought out the Runelords’ ancient secrets. You may have been the apprentice to another Pathfinder who perished on an expedition, leaving you their discoveries and notes. Or perhaps you explored several of these sites yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch magic extinguish your life.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. Add Thassilonian to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 4 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Demon Slayer Background</dt><dd><p>For over a century, Mendev led a multinational coalition against ever-growing abyssal invaders in the Worldwound, and the Pathfinder Society aided in the so-called Fifth Crusade that ultimately sealed the planar rift and defeated its demon armies. You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped—or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat. Add Abyssal to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 5 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scholar of the Sky Key Background</dt><dd><p>The unfamiliar technology of Numeria’s Silver Mount still baffles Society scholars, yet you are one of the innovators who discovered how to operate a handful of these futuristic tools—possibly after surviving more than a few explosions. The Society might have recruited you for your esoteric abilities, or you might have sought out the Society’s protection in escaping the covetously vile Technic League. Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Former Aspis Agent Background</dt><dd><p>For more than a century, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with the avaricious and underhanded Aspis Consortium, and several years ago the Society dealt its rival a decisive blow. You may be one of the few survivors of a doomed Aspis expedition, or perhaps you chafed at the Consortium’s villainous practices and defected to the Pathfinders. No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. You gain access to any uncommon options as though you were a member of the Aspis Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 7 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Savior of Air Background</dt><dd><p>Upon securing the Untouchable Opal, an artifact of extraordinary power, the Pathfinder Society endeavored to free the benevolent demigod Ranginori, who was trapped within the virtually unbreakable prison. You might have joined the Pathfinder Society in its expeditions to the Elemental Planes, or you might have lived on one of those planes before learning of the Society from these Pathfinder agents. You are no stranger to navigating precarious terrain as a result.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill, plus either Elemental Lords Lore or a Lore skill related either to one of the Elemental Planes (such as Plane of Air Lore). You gain the Cat Fall skill feat. Add Auran to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faction Opportunist Background</dt><dd><p>As the Pathfinder Society’s influence has grown, so too did many of its factions become wealthier and more powerful. These factions relied on a host of Pathfinders and independent operatives alike to establish trade networks, shape national politics, and more, and you were among the specialists who helped one of these factions realize its goal. These events provided you countless opportunities to develop your own contacts and negotiating skills.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill, plus either Guild Lore, Heraldry Lore, or Mercantile Lore. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tapestry Refugee Background</dt><dd><p>Within her magnificent museum demiplane, the sorcerer Hao Jin extracted and preserved countless sites and cultures. The demiplane’s unraveling magic forced the Pathfinder Society to evacuate the many inhabitants recently, and you were among the refugees who returned to the Material Plane after centuries of isolation. Whether you joined the Society out of gratitude, curiosity, or desperation, you are hardened by your harrowing flight from your doomed home.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Medicine or Stealth skill, plus a Lore skill related to the terrain you lived in while on the demiplane (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the Assurance skill feat with the skill you chose to become trained in (Medicine or Stealth).</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-Credit"><span class="xref std std-term">Credit</span></a> for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 10 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
