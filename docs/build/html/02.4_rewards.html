</dd>
<dt>Promotional</dt><dd><p>These boons reward players for promoting the society, or for exceptional contributions to the campaign. Characters may only benefit from one promotional boon during an adventure.</p>

The greater a character’s Reputation the more respected and influential they are with that faction. Characters can represent more that one Faction in their career, but only one per adventure. Some scenarios grant bonus Reputation with particular factions; this doesn’t prevent characters from choosing to represent a different Faction.</p>
