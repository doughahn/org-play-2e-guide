Adventures
************

There are two types of adventures written for the Pathfinder Society campaign. 

  Pathfinder Society Quests
    These are short adventures written for Pathfinder Society and intended to take about 1 hour to play.
  
  Pathfinder Society Scenarios 
    These are the most common adventure type written for Pathfinder Society, and they typically take about 4–5 hours to complete.

In addition to these, several of the other adventures Paizo produces have been sanctioned for society play.  All of these are published for a wider audience than the Pathfinder Society campaign, so such adventures often include a short, downloadable sanctioning document that details any special considerations for running the adventure for organized play, as well as Chronicles for the individual volumes.

  Pathfinder Adventure Paths 
    Multi-volume campaigns representing dozens of game sessions to complete. Many Adventure Paths are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.
  
  Pathfinder Adventures
    Stand-alone adventure books that take one or more sessions to complete. Many Adventures are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.
  
  Bounties
    Short one-hour adventures aimed at  introducing new Players to the game or representing what characters do in between Pathfinder missions. Bounties are sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign. As a sanctioned adventure, bounties do not give down time.

Sanctioned adventures operate in Campaign Mode, which does not use Pathfinder Society rules. GMs set the rules on character creation and may freely modify the encounters and story.  Sanctioned adventures award a Chronicle which may be applied to Pathfinder Society characters as outlined in the sanctioning documents.  Sanctioning documents reside on a product’s description page at paizo.com.

Scenario Tags
***************
Tags are markers that appear both on a scenario’s product page and on its title page that gives key information about the scenario’s contents.

  Exclusive
    Scenarios with this tag have running requirements outside the standard one table environment. Scenarios with this tag include specific rules on who is eligible to run it and where and how it can be run.
  
  Faction
    Scenarios with this tag list one or more associated factions—for example, “Faction (Envoy’s Alliance).” This tag generally corresponds to scenarios with additional Reputation awards for the associated factions.
  
  Metaplot 
    This adventure contributes to the season’s ongoing storyline.
  
  Repeatable 
    Players and GMs may receive credit for scenarios with this tag t an unlimited number of times, though characters can only receive credit once for a given scenario.

Levels
******

Pathfinder Society Adventurers are designed for characters of various levels playing together. The range of levels supported by an adventure appears on the cover. The difficulty of the adventure scales based on the character levels and is calculated using the challenge point system. 

Legal Table Size
************************

Pathfinder Society adventures are written for four (or more) Players.  However, in cases where you simply cannot seat four Players, the GM can make the following adjustments.

  Adventures with a Minimum level of 5 or lower
    For these adventures, the GM can run a table of two or three Players, and can add additional appropriately leveled pregenerated iconic characters in order to meet the minimum table size of four PCs.

    The GM can either play these characters themselves or deputize one or more Players to run them, provided the Player agrees to do so and feels capable of running an additional character.

    Pregenerated iconic characters are available for 1st level, 3rd level, and 5th level.

  Adventures with a minimum level of 7 or higher 
    These adventures can be run with only 3 Players, but only if all Players at the table agree.  While we expect this “hard mode” playthrough experience to be satisfying, we want to caution you that, as the adventures are designed for a minimum of four Players, they will be more difficult than normal. 
  
  All levels  
    If there are still not enough Players even with these adjustments, and there is a Player available who has already played the adventure, they can join the table, playing for no credit.  

  Replaying for No Credit 
    A Player may replay an adventure to help create a legal table. Replays grant no rewards.  Players should  record any items expended or gold spent and may be given a blank Chronicle for this purpose.  This is an exception to the restriction that you should never assign more than one copy of a Chronicle to a given character.

    GMs do not record organized play numbers for Players replaying for no credit Players. 

  Table Maximums 
    Tables cannot have seven or more Players. If seven Players show up to an event and there is more table space, see if one of the Players can GM a game instead.

Before the Adventure (Player)
******************************

Before the game starts, you will need to choose a character to play.  This can be one of your existing characters, or a pregenerated character.  But it must fall within the allowed levels for the adventure.  If you choose a pregenerated character, you must also choose an existing character of a lower level, a first level character, or a brand new character to assign credit to.  (See :ref:`Applying Credit` in After the Adventure to learn more about this process.)  

You must also choose if you are going to be using Standard or Slow advancement.  (Slow lets you play more adventures before leveling, Standard lets you level faster.)

Finally, you must choose which of the :ref:`Factions` your character would like to earn reputation with this adventure.  If you do not choose a different faction, you earn reputation with the Horizon Hunters.

The GM will provide you with a sign-in sheet to record your character’s name, Organized Play ID, Character Number, level, faction, and advancement speed, as well as any contact information the GM needs to be able to get chronicles to you.  If you are playing a pregen, then the character number is the number of the character who will receive credit for the adventure.

One Character per Adventure
=============================
You can have as many active characters as you want in Pathfinder Society. However, you can play only one of your characters during a specific adventure. Characters engaged in play-by-post are considered busy and may not be used in another game while the play-by-post is running.

One Adventure per Character
=============================
A character can only take part in one adventure at a time.  From the time the character begins an adventure, to the time Chronicles are issued, that character cannot be involved in any other adventure.

Replaying Adventures
----------------------
When replaying an adventure, or playing an adventure you have already GMed please follow the additional two guidelines.

1. Notify the GM: Inform the GM that you have already played the adventure or run it as a GM. Although a GM should endeavor to be flexible, the GM maintains the right to deny running the adventure for you if they feel uncomfortable running the event for Players who have foreknowledge of the story.
2. No Spoilers: When you are replaying an adventure, avoid spoiling the adventure’s plot or using insider information to affect gameplay. Doing so can be grounds for the GM to remove you from the table. In general, be mindful in separating Player knowledge from character knowledge, and if you are uncertain how to proceed, speak privately with the GM to determine the best course of action.

During the Adventure (Player)
******************************

Each adventure typically begins with a briefing, either in the form of a letter, a meeting with a venture-captain, or an offer of a job by an employer.  

Hero Points: Immediately after that briefing, the GM will distribute initial Hero Points.  Rules for Hero Points can be found on Page 467 of the Core Rulebook.  Some rewards, such as :ref:`GM Glyphs <Rewards>`, :ref:`Campaign Coins <Rewards>`, and :ref:`Order of the Wayfinder <Rewards>` provide the Players with extra Hero Points at this time.

School Consumables 
==================
In a Pathfinder Society Scenario, your character also receives gifts from their friends and connections before leaving on missions.  At this point, you can select your free consumable item or items from the list below.  You can choose a consumable from a level lower than yours if you wish.

If not used by the end of the adventure, the item is returned to the character’s contacts.  If you neglect to choose an item, you receive the default choice of a healing potion of the appropriate level.  Consumable items for Pregens are already included in their character sheets and do not gain additional consumable at this step.

   :widths: 10, 45, 45
   :header-rows: 1

Purchasing Equipment 
--------------------------

This will also often be the last opportunity your character has to purchase any needed equipment for the adventure.

**Explore, Report, Cooperate:** Remember, your character is a member of the Pathfinder Society, working with colleagues and friends, under the motto!

Treasure 
=========

As characters work their way through the adventure, they will discover or earn Treasure Bundles. These are simplified units that represent an even share of the adventure’s rewards. A standard scenario has a 10 such Treasure Bundles. The GM will track how many treasure bundles found and present the information to the Players at the end of the adventure. 

Don’t worry if you do not get all the treasure bundles. The game’s rewards are balanced around the assumption that you will get 8 or 9 treasure bundles on average.

Characters may also find named items of treasure or consumable magic items. These items are available for use during the adventure and often appear as purchasable items on Chronicles. 

Infamy
========

Infamy represents a character’s reputation for performing evil or criminal actions.  Some scenarios will call out specific actions that will cause characters one or more PCs to gain infamy.  Additionally the GM may assign infamy for other evil or criminal acts not called out by the scenario.

  Warnings 
    The GM must warn the Player that their act will incur Infamy.  This warning can be in character or out of character but must be clear to the Player.  If the PC goes through with the action, they earn the point of infamy.

  Effects of Infamy 
    Each point of infamy reduces the PCs effective level by one for purposes of purchasing gear.

If a PC ends a game with 3 Infamy, they are ejected from the Pathfinder Society and are no longer viable to play in the campaign.  The character should be marked dead when the table is reported.

**Infamy is not for Player actions. Players who commit or describe character actions in violation of the community standards are subject to disciplinary sanctions outlined in the :ref:`community policy <Violation Enforcement Procedures>`.**

After the Adventure (Player)
*****************************

Negative Effects
========================

The Pathfinder Society takes care of its members by removing most ongoing nonpermanent negative conditions and repairing  agents’ damaged gear to the condition it was in at the start of the scenario.

The following conditions are not automatically removed and must be cleared from the character before the end of the adventure or the character ceases to be available for organized play:

- Death
- Permanent petrification, polymorph effects, or negative conditions
- Curses

Other PCs can use their spells, feats or class abilities to assist characters in recovering from negative effects.  They can also contribute consumables or even some of their gold, but they are not required to.  Characters can always use gold earned during the adventure to clear conditions and those costs must be deducted on the scenario Chronicle by the GM. GMs should report characters with uncleared conditions as dead.

  Pregenerated Characters
    Condition removal applies to pregenerated characters and any unresolved conditions carry over to the Pathfinder Society character receiving credit for the adventure.  If that would mean the character would be marked dead, then that occurs immediately.

    When determining order of payment, Players should apply party funds, then Pathfinder Society character resources, then sale of pregenerated character gear. If sold to pay for removing a negative effect, a 1st-level character’s gear is worth 7.5 gold pieces, a 3rd-level character’s gear is worth 37.5 gold pieces, and a 5th-level character’s gear is worth 135 gold pieces.

Ongoing and Permanent Spells
================================================

All permanent or ongoing spell effects end at the end of the adventure, just after resolving negative conditions, with the exception of *Continual Flame*, and *Secret Page*. A character may carry over one of each of these spells to the next adventure. Record any ongoing spells along with equipment, along with the organized play number and Character ID of the caster, as well as the Level and DC of the spell. Spells lost by subsequent castings, counteracted, or otherwise lost must be crossed off the record.

Reputation
================================================
Reputation is a measure of how influential your character is with a particular faction, and higher scores open up new and more powerful ways that the faction can help you. In each adventure, characters who champion a faction’s ideals earn  Reputation.  Your character has a different Reputation score for each faction. You can read the Character Rewards page for more about the effects of :ref:`Reputation <Table: Faction Reputations>` or the :ref:`PC Reputation` page for more about how reputation is awarded.

Treasures and Gold
====================

Unlike a traditional game in which the PCs would divide recovered magic items and other treasure among themselves, Pathfinder Society awards each participating PC a share of gold pieces based on their respective levels. Rather than divide up the magic items unequally, PCs have equal access to any special treasure found, represented by the items listed on the Chronicle.  Rules for purchasing these items can be found under :ref:`Purchasing Guidelines`.

Downtime
=========

Between adventures, each character may participate in Downtime activities.  Scenarios and Quests grant two days of downtime per XP earned. Characters that chose :ref:`field-commissioned agent <Membership in the Pathfinder Society>` during step 11 of character creation earn 3 days of downtime per XP.

A character can always use Downtime as described in the Core Rulebook on Crafting, Earn Income, and retraining. Other downtime activities might apply based on  Achievement Point boons or as described in the adventure.  Downtime must be spent at the end of the session or it expires; it cannot be stockpiled for later use, though characters may engage in Downtime activities that span multiple sessions.  Consult GM Basics more on the detailed mechanics of :ref:`Downtime` in PFS.

Levelling Up
=============

Characters accumulate XP every time they play an adventure.. For every 12 XP earned, characters advance 1 level.  

This progression is roughly equivalent to the Slow Advancement progression (`Core Rulebook 509 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=574>`_). Leveling up happens after all other rewards for the scenario are calculated, including Downtime, however characters can still purchase equipment after levelling up.  Characters who earned  the requisite number of XP must level before joining another game. XP is *NOT* reset to zero after characters level.  

Record-Keeping
=================
Organized play characters rely on good recordkeeping to ensure accurate information while playing.  Several methods of tracking exist, but the most prevalent is the Chronicle. Every organized play published or sanctioned adventure contains a Chronicle, though Players can choose alternative tracking methods and keep the Chronicles as backup.

Upon completing an adventure, Players each receive a Chronicle sheet from the GM.  This sheet includes a summary of the adventure; indications of any choices made along the way which may impact the future of the campaign, and a log of rewards earned while exploring. It also provides areas for notes, purchases, and the acquisition/removal of conditions. Players using other tracking methods should ensure all the data on the Chronicle is reflected in their records.

Record Format
---------------
Players may choose to keep their records digitally or in paper files. If stored digitally, Players must be comfortable with GMs handling their device while reviewing records. If in paper files, all pages must be carried to games.


Applying Credit
------------------
Chronicles and their associated information is assigned to the character identified on the registration sheet.  Information from the Chronicle applies when the character adds the Chronicle to their record. Credit applies immediately except for the following circumstances:

Sanctioned Pathfinder Adventures and Adventure Paths 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These adventures often grant a single Chronicles with 12 or more XP. Characters should apply the XP (and the proportional rewards) in blocks of 4, so that characters may level between applications. 

Pregenerated Characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chronicles not being applied to 1st level characters should be held until the assigned character reaches the level of the pregenerated character. Pregen chronicles assigned to 1st level characters gain the following limitations:
- Award Treasure Bundles/Gold as if the earning character was 1st level.
- Characters do not  benefit from any boons or item unlocks until the character reaches the minimum Chronicle level 
- Downtime applies as to a 1st level character.
- Chronicles apply in the order in which they were played. Add all earned rewards and make Downtime checks before applying the next Chronicle. Applying credit in batches may advance a character multiple levels. The character’s level cannot exceed the level of any Chronicle applied to them, so any out-of-level Chronicles applied are lost. 


Digital Records
-----------------
Chronicles and their associated information is assigned to the character identified on the registration.  Information from the Chronicle applies when the character adds the Chronicle to their record.

Rewards
*******

Boons
=====
Boons are rewards that can be applied to a character. Common types of boons include Achievemnet Points (AcP), Chronicle, or Faction.  Boons often have traits that describe how the boon applies. There are some boon traits that deserve specific mention:

  Advanced  
    A boon with the Advanced trait is typically more powerful than other boons.  Characters may only benefit from one advanced boon during an adventure.
  Ally
    A boon with the Ally trait often places a Pawn. An Ally boon that places a Pawn cannot be used if the PC has already placed a second Pawn this game..
  Promotional 
    These boons reward Players for promoting the society, or for exceptional contributions to the campaign. Characters may only benefit from one advanced boon during an adventure.

Unless a boon states otherwise, you can only apply one of any given boon to a character.

Promotional Boons
------------------
These boons are available, automatically, to any Player who meets their requirements.

  Promotional Accessory
    Type: promotional
    Prerequisites: Player is wearing or carrying an accessory that promotes Pathfinder Society
    Benefit: Up to twice per adventure, you can spend an action to reduce the severity of your frightened or stupefied condition by 1.
    *Special:* A PC can only benefit from one promotional boon per game.

  Promotional Service Award
    Type: promotional
    Prerequisites: Have a campaign coin, Member of the Order of the Wayfinder.
    Benefit: Volunteers who make exceptional contributions to Organized Play can earn campaign coins or membership in the Order of the Wayfinder as a recognition of their hard work. When you use this boon, you gain a bonus Hero Point at the beginning of the adventure. In addition to the normal powers of a Hero Point, you can spend this special Hero Point to allow another Player to reroll a check.
    *Special:* A PC can only benefit from one promotional boon per game.

  Promotional Vestments
    Type: promotional
    Prerequisites: Player is wearing clothing that promotes Pathfinder Society, such as a volunteer shirt, a shirt for a Pathfinder Lodge, or Pathfinder-themed cosplay
    Benefit: When you use a Hero Point to reroll a check, add a +1 cirumstance bonus to the reroll.
    *Special:* A PC can only benefit from one promotional boon per game.


Achievement Points
=========================
Players earn Achievement Points (AcP) by participating in and reporting Pathfinder Society games. AcP are an online currency used to purchase character boons. Currently, there are three levels of AcP events.The number of points earned depends on time involved, the event level, and the type of involvement as in the chart below. Event classifications are:

- **Standard events:** games played in stores, homes, or other  locations .
- **Premier events:** games played at conventions and local events designated part of the Regional Support Program. 
- **Premier Plus events:** Paizo-sponsored conventions and conventions running more than 75 blocks of organized play.

*Not all Adventures and Adventure Path books award 12 XP. See the individual sanctioning documents for details.*

A list of  Achievement Points rewards available for purchase lives on the Boon tab of your `My Organized Play page <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. To purchase a boon, select a character from the dropdown list, then click the purchase button of the desired boon. A list of purchased boons appears at the bottom of the page. Each purchased boon generates a downloadable printable boon. AcP boons should be stored with Chronicles, either digitally or alongside physical sheets. 

Retail Incentive Program 
===================================
The Retail Incentive Program (RIP) rewards Players with rewards for their characters when they patronize retailers who are providing space for Organized Play activities.  Purchases made at the location within a stated time frame tally by table and unlock benefits at different levels, including some that reduce the severity of failures, for the next game played. Implementation methods vary from store to store, and are posted for attendees to review. For more information, read the `full policy <https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies#retailers>`_ and consult your Event Organizer for details.

Legacy Backgrounds (legacy campaign) 
=============================================
Even though characters from the First Edition legacy campaign cannot transfer into the current Pathfinder Society campaign, their exploits can shape the Society’s newest adventurers. For each of the 11 seasons of the legacy campaign, a Player can unlock a special legacy character background associated with that season by having completed five or more of that season’s scenarios. These backgrounds are unique to the Pathfinder Society campaign, and once they’re unlocked, a Player use a legacy background for any number of characters. See Legacy Backgrounds.

Faction & Reputation
===================================
By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction’s interests, a character gains Reputation with the represented faction. The greater a character’s Reputation the more respected and influential they are with that faction. Characters can represent more that one Faction in their career, but only one per adventure. Some scenarios grant bonus Reputation with particular factions; this doesn’t prevent characters from choosing to represent a different Faction.

Pathfinder Society uses the Reputation subsystem (`Gamemastery Guide 164 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1234>`_)  with the following modifications:  

Table: Faction Reputations
----------------------------------------

.. csv-table:: 
   :file: _static/csv/factionReps.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Reputation in PFS does not use negative values. Major infractions earn Infamy.

Character rewards unlocked by Reputation are found on the Boon Tab of your `My Organized Play page <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. Rewards can unlock based on Reputation with a single faction, or the total amount of Reputation your character has earned across all factions.

Other Rewards 
---------------------------

Pathfinder Society Organized Play periodically releases additional prizes for special events. The most common among these are charity boons, which are in-game benefits sent to authorized charity events to help raise money for good causes. For more information on Charity Boons, ask the Event Organizer.
