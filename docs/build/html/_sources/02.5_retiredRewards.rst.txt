Retired Rewards
##############################

***********************************
Playtest Points
***********************************
Playtest Points (playtest adventures): During the playtest period for Pathfinder Second Edition, players and GMs did not earn Chronicles when playing the 11 playtest adventures. Instead, each participant earned a number of Playtest Points, which can now be redeemed on your `Organized Play account at Paizo <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. These rewards include Limited-Use boons, the ability to start a character at 2nd or 3rd level to reflect the time spent playing the game, and other minor benefits.


***********************************
Faction Boon Errata
***********************************
Starting in season 2, Adventures no longer give Fame. There will be a new Faction boon System coming out, in the next few months, and a mechanism to transition your boons over to the new system. Once the new system is in place, you will no longer be able to buy Faction boons with fame. The current date for the transition is 10/20/2020

Additionally, the following faction boons have been changed.

- Alliance Champion boons no longer do anything and have ceased to exist.
- All characters gain the effect of the Home Region boon for free at character creation. As such, the boon no longer serves any function.

Heroic Resurgence
-----------------------------------------
**Replace** “Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and you also gain a circumstance bonus to your damage rolls, Perception checks, skill checks, and saving throws equal to the noted value (maximum +2 for Reputation tier 3, or +3 for Reputation tier 4).”

**With** “Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, Perception checks, skill checks, and saving throws.”

Crafter’s Workshop  
-----------------------------------------
**Replace**: “When you Craft during Downtime, you do not need to spend 4 days at work before attempting a Crafting check.”

**With** “You only need to spend 1 day of downtime before attempting your skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective cost.”

**And Remove**: “ However, your fellow faction members expect your assistance in return. After slotting this boon to reduce the time needed to Craft an item, you must keep it slotted until you have finished crafting that item.”

Hireling Boons
-----------------------------------------
**Replace**: “The hireling’s result cannot be modified by class abilities or spells, but it can be improved by a successful Aid check. ” 

**With**:  “The hireling doesn’t have or use its own ability modifiers and can never benefit from item bonuses, status bonuses, or fortune effects.  Abilities that grant you a circumstance bonus do not grant that circumstance bonus to your hireling even though you are using your action to attempt the check.  You cannot aid your own hireling.”

**Replace**: The hireling does not participate directly in combat

**With**: You cannot use the hirelings skills except recall knowledge in combat, and the hireling cannot be affected by, or affect combat. 

**Replace**: “Special You can purchase this boon multiple times.”
   
**With**: “Special You can purchase this boon multiple times, but may only benefit from one hireling boon on any given adventure”

**Disclaimer:  Some of these rewards were still under development.  Some as written may not work as intended.  Those boons are noted in the tables below.**

***********************************
Faction Boon Rewards
*********************************** 
Factions offer a variety of rewards. These a PC can access by gaining Reputation with a particular faction and then spending Fame to purchase specific boons. In addition to faction-specific rewards, there are numerous generic rewards that are accessible to all factions based on the amount of Reputation a PC’s earned. The rewards take the form of boons, which follow the same rules as those found in the :ref:`Boons` section.

Reputation Tiers: By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction’s interests, a PC gains Reputation with that faction. The greater a PC’s Reputation with a faction, the more respected and influential they are with that faction, represented by their Reputation Tier. These tiers are numbered 0 through 4, with a Reputation Tier of 0 representing no relationship with the faction, and a Reputation Tier of 4 representing the height of prestige within the faction. To advance to a higher Reputation Tier, a PC must increase their Reputation for that faction to the values listed in the following table.

All Faction Boons

*Special Note*: To calculate your current Reputation Tier for the purpose of purchasing rewards listed in Table 2: All Factions Retired Rewards, add up your Reputation from all factions and reference that table.

For example, a character with 11 Reputation with the Vigilant Seal and 27 with the Envoys’ Alliance has a total Reputation of 38 and therefore qualifies as Reputation Tier 2 when accessing the All Factions rewards.

The following section details the boons that PCs can purchase with Fame.

A-N
-----------------------------------------
  Adversary Lore
    **Prerequisites** Vigilant Seal Tier 1

    **Cost** 4 Fame

    It doesn’t matter how powerful your weapons are if you don’t know where to strike. Before an adventure, you take time to study a certain category of creatures, making it easier to recall their capabilities later. When you purchase this boon, either select one creature type from List 1 below, or choose two creature types from List 2. While this boon is slotted, you have a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures of the selected type(s). If your Reputation Tier for the Vigilant Seal faction is 4, this bonus increases to +2.

    **List 1** aberration, animal, beast, construct, dragon, elemental, fiend, undead.

    **Special** You can benefit from this boon only a number of times equal to your current Reputation Tier with the Grand Archive faction. Each time you fulfill the requirements of this boon, mark it on your Chronicle sheet along with the associated Reputation Tier. Have the GM sign beside this notation.

  Beginnings and Endings
    slotless

  Bequeathal
    service

    **Prerequisites** All Factions Tier 3

    **Cost** Varies

    Pathfinders often find strange treasures for which they might not have any use, yet one of their colleagues would benefit. When you acquire this boon, select one uncommon, rare, or unique character option to which you’ve gained access through an adventure’s Chronicle sheet (e.g., a boon that allows you to acquire a **Special** animal companion or purchase a **Special** magic item). Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that **Special** option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle sheet’s adventure (e.g., 5th level for Tier 5–8). On the Chronicle sheet, write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character’s number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must sell it back if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).

    The **Cost** of this boon is 4 Fame for an uncommon option, 8 Fame for a rare option, and 12 Fame for a unique option.

    **Special** You can purchase this boon multiple times. Each time you bequeath a different character option.

  Charitable Adventure
    slotless

    **Prerequisites** Radiant Oath Tier 1

    **Cost** 0 Fame

When you acquire this boon choose a permanent magic item of your level or lower to which you have access. While you have this boon slotted, you can spend Downtime erasing the item’s stubborn curse. This uses the same rules as you would to Craft the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion in place of Crafting (such as to determine the progress you make and the maximum item level you can work on). Second, your faction provides you the necessary tools and workspace to perform this operation. Third, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item’s effective **Cost**.
