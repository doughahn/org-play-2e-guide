Player Character Overview
*********************************

Pathfinder Society characters use the process outlined in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, with a few additional campaign-specific rules and benefits. Characters start at first level unless they have Boons to modify their starting level. The Character Creation appendix contains step-by-step instructions to help you create your own Roleplaying Guild character and outlines the campaign’s additional character creation steps.. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure your character is suitable for the organized play campaign.  

Remember to :ref:`register your character <Register for Organized Play>` register your character at `paizo.com <https://paizo.com/>`_!

Character Options
===========================

All of the ancestries, backgrounds, and classes from the Core Rulebook are available to you when creating a character. You might need to spend :ref:`Achievement Points` to access some ancestries and options from other books before you can use them in organized play. More information on approved resources can be found in the `Character Options Blog <https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh3j?Pathfinder-Society-Character-Options>`_.
  
  Rarity
    Some options within the game have a rarity trait of uncommon, rare, or unique. Options without a rarity trait are considered common.  Rarity is described on page `13 of the Core Rulebook <http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=36>`_.

  Access 
    Players can access uncommon or rare options via access points built into the campaign. If you satisfy the access condition specified in that option, then that option is common for you. Pathfinder Society  characters are enrolled members of the Pathfinder Society organization in the world of Golarion, so they gain access to all options requiring  membership in the Pathfinder Society.

    `The Pathfinder Society Rarity and Availability blog <https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcs?Rarity-and-Availability-in-Organized-Play>`_ contains specific examples on how to access uncommon and rare character options. 

  Pawns
    In Encounter Mode, each PC is typically represented by a pawn. Animal Companions, purchased animals and summoned creatures, and any other creature whose location affects combat are also usually represented by some sort of pawn. With the exception of temporary creatures who last no more than an encounter or two, such as those created by summon spells, no character can place more than 2 pawns per adventure. Familiars who stay in their owner’s square during encounter mode do not require pawns.

Rebuilding Your Character
=========================
After playing a new character, you might find aspects of your character you would like to change.  Don’t worry!  Until you play a game in which your character starts with 12 or more XP, you can freely rebuild your character completely. The character retains their Reputation earned and character number. Once you begin a session as a second level character, you still have options for changing your character’s choices through :ref:`Achievement Points` purchases or retraining.

You cannot use Rebuilding or Retraining to build a character that could not be built without using either of those two tools.


How to Build a Character
************************************

This section details the steps for creating a character for the Pathfinder Society. These steps mirror those in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits.

Resources
=========
Players may use any Paizo published books or supplements they own during character creation, provided the options are valid per the `Character Options resource document <https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcs?Rarity-and-Availability-in-Organized-Play>`_, Players residing in the same household may share owned resources. Options in the `Paizo Core Rulebook <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook>`_ and `Lost Omens: Character Guide <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide>`_ are considered always available resources regardless of ownership.

Character Creation Guidelines
=============================
The following steps elaborate and expand on character creation for Pathfinder Society characters. (`Core Rulebook 21 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=66>`_)

1. Create a Concept
---------------------------
Remember, your character is a member of the Pathfinder Society first and foremost, and as such, your character should be able to work with any other Pathfinder, and abide by the Society’s Motto – **“Explore, Report, Cooperate”**.

2. Start Building Ability Scores
---------------------------------------------
Pathfinder Society uses the standard method detailed under “Ability Score Overview” on `page 20 of the Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=74>`_. Your character can also take two additional ability flaws to gain one additional ability boost as described in the `Voluntary Flaws sidebar on page 26 of the Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=86>`_.

3. Select an Ancestry
------------------------------------
Ancestry follows the normal rules in the *Core Rulebook*, with minor modifications to adapt to the languages of Golarion.  The Pathfinder society does not permit Half-elves or Half-orcs of ancestries other than Human.

  Home Region
    This is also the stage at which you should choose your character’s home region (Core Rulebook 420-429), and in the case of human characters, your ethnicity. (Core Rulebook 430-431).  Home regions fulfill access requirements and prerequisites for character options. See Rarity for more information.

  Languages
    All Pathfinder Society characters are literate and speak Common (Taldan) as well as any other languages granted by their ancestry. Regional languages (Core Rulebook 432) are uncommon and require access.

4. Pick A Background
---------------------------
Players who participated in the Pathfinder Society (first edition) campaign have access to Legacy Backgrounds in addition to the backgrounds starting on page 60 of the Core Rulebook. 

5. Choose a Class
---------------------------
All Pathfinder Society characters begin at 1st level, although some boons allow a character to immediately advance to 2nd or 3rd level at the end of character creation

6. Determine Ability Scores
------------------------------------
The Pathfinder Society follows the standard rules for Determining Ability scores.

7. Record Class Details
------------------------------------
The Pathfinder society follows all the standard rules for Class Details.

8. Buy Equipment
---------------------------
All characters in Pathfinder Society begin with the standard 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) that can be spent on starting gear. Chapter 6 of the Core Rulebook has a wide array of useful starting gear. Page 289 of the Core Rulebook includes class kits, prebuilt selections of gear tailored to each of the core classes. You can also spend your wealth to purchase additional gear, as described in the Purchasing Guidelines.

9. Calculate Modifiers
------------------------------------
Calculate your character’s Perception, Saving Throws, Strikes, and Skill modifiers as described on page 27 of the `Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=89>`_. 

10. Finishing Details
---------------------------
  Alignment
    Players cannot play evil characters. When choosing an alignment, be sure it satisfies any alignment requirements for your character’s class.

  Religion
    Characters can worship any Golarion deity so long as their alignment matches one of the deity’s listed follower alignments. Champions and clerics must choose a valid deity, though other classes can worship one of the faiths and philosophies presented on page 440 of Core Rulebook or another legal source. Characters can also be agnostic or atheist.

    Characters can revere deities they do not worship. Revering a deity means that your character might do things like wearing the deity’s holy symbol, attending the deity’s religious services, or performing other acts of obeisance that aren’t rewarded with spells or divine powers. 

    A character can revere as many deities as they wish, but can worship and receive power from only one.

  Age
    Characters must be at least young adults to be accepted as members of the Pathfinder Society.

  Other Items
    The beginning of Pathfinder Society games includes character introductions, so consider making a few notes on your character’s appearance, personality, and pronouns to share with other Players. The World of Pathfinder Society and the `Lost Omens: Character Guide <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide>`_ both contain information on the campaign setting you can use for this purpose.

    Pathfinder uses maps with a standard 1-inch grid to determine movement and tactical positioning in combat, so you need a physical representation of your character to use on the grid. Paizo produces a wide range of Pathfinder Pawns and also works with Reaper Miniatures and WizKids to offer a wide variety of gaming miniatures, so you can find just the right figure for your character.

    For digital play, this should be a digital image.  Speak to your DM about their preferred image formats and size requirements.

Membership in the Pathfinder Society
---------------------------------------------
During their training, Pathfinder initiates attain a certain level of proficiency in all three schools’ teachings, from there some go on to specialize in one of the schools’ curricula and build life-long professional contacts with like-minded scholars while others continue to divide their time among the different schools. These contacts pay out over the course of a Pathfinder’s career in the form of  gifts from colleagues.  In practice, these relationships provides characters one or more consumable items at the beginning of each scenario. In return, the field agent’s expected to return the favor by contributing labor, teaching expertise, lab assistance, or more between missions, reinforcing these professional relationships.  

Another way to join the Pathfinder Society is via a field commission from another agent or a Venture-Captain of the Society. Characters who received a field commission have fewer connections to the Society’s  membership, and receive fewer gifts, but have fewer obligations to the society and thus more downtime.  

  Pathfinder Training
    Each character should choose one of the following: Spells, Scrolls Swords, Generalist, or Field Commission. Each of these choices grants a bonus lore at first level, and a bonus skill feat at 5th level. Each Pathfinder Training (except Field Commission) also grants a bonus consumable at the beginning of each mission.

Purchasing Guidelines
=======================

Purchasing Guidelines
You can always purchase the following items so long as you’re in a settlement of at least 5,000 residents (and scenarios might sometimes provide additional allowances or limitations):

- Any common equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level (minimum 2).
- Any uncommon equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level (minimum 2); your character must have access to this uncommon equipment such as through meeting its Access condition.
- Any equipment listed on your character’s Chronicles with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level + 2. Some items found on Chronicles are available for purchase only a limited number of times.  Weapons and Armor found on Chronicles can be upgraded following the normal rules for upgrading.
- Any basic equipment weapon or armor your character has access to can be purchased in a precious material version, provided you have access to weapons or armor made of that precious material. The weapon or armor must still meet any requirements stipulated in the listing for the precious material in question.
- Any items and services purchased with :ref:`Achievement Points`.

Note that accumulating :ref:`Infamy` can reduce the character’s effective level when purchasing equipment.

Formulas
------------------
The pathfinder society will sell formulas to members for any non-limited item for which the agent has access. Items with a number restriction, including Unique Items, are considered so esoteric that the Society does not own the formula and so complicated that it is not possible to reverse engineer the formula even with a legendary degree of skill.

Selling Back Equipment
------------------------------------
Equipment can only be sold back for ½ the gold spent to buy it.  Equipment that was purchased as part of a bundle, such as a class kit, or a magic weapon can only be sold back as part of the same bundle, and all parts of the bundle must be sold.  Partially consumed items cannot be sold back.  Rebuild boons stating kit value are an exception to the ½ price resale.

Applying and Transferring Runes
------------------------------------
The Society has a specialist at the Grand Lodge who can apply or swap out runes for agents of the Pathfinder Society in good standing.  This service is free, and requires no check, but is only available before the briefing or once the adventure is complete unless stated in the adventure.  Only the service of transfering the rune is free however.  Characters must still pay the 10% materials cost and provide any required runestones.
