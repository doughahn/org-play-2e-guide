# Pathfinder Society Guide to Organized Play (2nd Edition)

This is a proof of concept for a read the docs project using Paizo's [2e Guide](http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/paizo/guides/pfs2guide-en/). 

To get started, read the [Getting Started with Sphinx Guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html) on Read the Docs. To build this project locally you will need a very basic understanding of Python and using the command line. 

To help edit this project you should understand how to edit [ReStructured Text](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demo/demo.html#paragraph-level-markup) at the paragraph level. (It's like Markdown; no harder than the BBCode on the Paizo boards.) You will also need a basic understanding of [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github) and how to make [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
